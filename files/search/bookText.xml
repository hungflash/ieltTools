            8  An example of this is when a student pays someone to write a paper for a class.  The

             1. When making a list, it is common to use three items. In sentence 1, delete or. Then
              add or other work after the word ideas so the sentence has three items instead of
              just two. Add commas to the list of three items.
             2. In sentence 2, add the word very.

             3. In sentence 2, add the word problem and insert the article a in the correct place.

             4. In sentence 2, it is not clear where the problem is. Add the phrase at colleges and
              universities after the word problem.

             5. In sentence 4, since the statement is not true for all students, add sometimes to
              the beginning of the sentence.

             6. In sentence 5, replace the word several with 10.

             7. Replace the word very with especially in sentence 6.

             8. In sentence 6, give more information about the students by adding the word
              college.
             9. In sentence 8, change the word paper to essay. Change the article.

             10. Combine sentences 10 and 11 using so.

                                  the United States, the legislative branch has the power to make laws.  In some ways,
                                  the legislative branch in Japan is similar to the U.S. legislative branch.  For example, the
                                                                                                5
                                  Japanese legislative branch has two houses: the House of Representatives and the House

                                  of Councillors.  The United States also have two houses: the Senate and the House of
                                               6

                                  Representatives.  In short, the Japanese and American government systems are similar
                                  in several important areas.

             1. Combine sentences 1 and 2 with the connector but.

             2. In sentence 3, the subject and the verb (they have) are repeated. Change the sentence so that it will

              have only one subject and one verb. (Hint: Will you need the comma?)

             3. In sentence 4, the word some is vague. Replace it with several.

             4. In sentence 5, use the phrase for example or for instance to introduce the example.

             5. In sentence 6, add the phrase in addition to introduce an additional example.

             6. In sentence 7, explain what honey is. Add a comma after the word honey and this information: which
              is their food.

             7. Sentence 8 has information that is very different from all the other information so far. Start with in

              contrast to show this difference.
             8. Explain the word predator in sentence 8. After the word predator, put a comma and then add this

              information to give an example of how wasps are predators: which means they catch and eat other
              insects.

                                  have certain habits.  First of all, happy people smile a lot.  They smile even if they are

                                  not happy.  Smiling changes a person’s attitude, experts say.  Secondly, happy people
                                  eat well.  They eat nutritious, high-energy foods and usually avoid processed and fast

                                  food.  Happy people also live in the present.  They do not reﬂect on the past or worry
                                                                          9

                                  about the future.  Furthermore, even though happy people tend to live in the present,
                                                                              11

                                         Digital Books vs. Printed Books

                     1  Digital books are better than print books for college students.  Digital books are
                                                                            2
                 less expensive than printed textbooks.  For example, the price of a typical electronic
                                                   3
                 version of a college psychology textbook is less than the print version.  Digital books
                                                                               4
                 are much more convenient than print books.  For example, the average textbook weighs
                                                         5
                 almost four pounds.  An e-reader with several textbooks on it weighs less.  More
                                                                                   7
                                   6
                 learning takes place with digital books than with print textbooks.  This is because digital
                                                                           8
                 books can connect to dictionaries and the Internet, so students can look up words they

                 do not know.  They can also get more background information on the topic they are
                             9
                 reading about.  It is clear from these facts that digital books are superior to print books.

                 1. In sentence 1, add the phrase in my opinion to show it is the writer’s opinion.

                 2. In sentence 2, add a word that shows this is the ﬁrst reason.
                 3. In sentence 3, be more precise about the difference in price by adding about 50

                 4. In sentence 4, add a word to show that this is the second reason.

                 5. In sentence 6, add a detail that gives more information about the weight. (Hint: An
                   e-reader weighs less than a half a pound, no matter how many books it contains.)
                 6. Combine sentences 5 and 6 to show a contrast. (Hint: Add although.)

                 7. In sentence 7, add a word that shows that this is the last idea in the list.

                 8. In sentence 8, change words they do not know to unknown words.

                 9. Combine sentences 8 and 9.
                 10. Make sentence 10 a little more precise by adding the phrase for college students.


                 ACTIVITY 10   Original Writing


               On a separate sheet of paper, write an opinion paragraph (at least ﬁve sentences) about
               a topic that interests you. Support your opinion with facts and details. Use at least
               three examples of present verbs and underline them.
               Here are some examples of how to begin.

                1 Americans are eating less meat.  The reason people are eating less meat is that they
                                             2
            are worried about their health.  People want to be healthier.  People want to live longer.

            5 Many people are concerned about high cholesterol, so they are eating meat substitutes
            like veggie burgers.  Also, people are worried that certain kinds of meat cause cancer.
                              6
            7 Besides health concerns, Americans are buying less meat because the price of meat is

            rising.  Finally, concern for the environment is causing people to eat less meat.  It takes

            are eating less meat.



             1. In sentence 1, not all Americans are eating less meat. Add the word many in the
              correct place.

             2. In this short paragraph the verb eat occurs ﬁve times. It is not good to repeat one
              word so often. In sentence 2, change eating less meat to making this change.

             3. The writer gives several reasons, not just one, why people are eating less meat. In
              sentence 2, change The reason to The number one reason.

             4. People is the subject of both sentences 3 and 4. Use the subject pronoun in
              sentence 4.
             5. Begin sentence 5 with the word nowadays.

             6. In sentence 6, change the opening word also to the phrase in addition.

             7. Sentence 6 needs an example of the type of meat, so add the phrase such as
              sausage after the word meat.

              NARRATIVE PARAGRAPH

                                 The First and Last Trip of the Titanic

                1  On April 10, 1912, the RMS Titanic left England for the United States.  It was
                                                                            2
            the largest passenger ship ever built.  It was so big and so safe that people called it
                                            3
            “unsinkable.”  The ship was carrying a total of 2,240 passengers.  At around 11:30 p.m. on
                        4
                                                                   5
            the fourth night of the trip, the Titanic was sailing in calm water under a clear sky.  Most
                                                                                  6
            of the passengers were sleeping.  The ship was moving at full speed.  Suddenly one of

            the ship’s crewmembers, Frederick Fleet, saw an iceberg.  The ship was heading directly

            toward it.  Fleet rang a bell and called the captain.  The captain tried to turn the ship to

                                                              13
            turning.  The ship began to sink.  By the next morning, the ship was underwater.  More
                                                                                   16

            than 1,550 people died in the disaster, and close to 700 people survived.  They are all gone

            now, but some remaining parts of the Titanic are still lying at the bottom of the ocean today.


             1. Combine sentences 1 and 2. Delete It was and put the rest of sentence 2 between
              the RMS Titanic and left for England. Remember to put commas around the phrase.

             2. In sentence 3, change It to The Titanic to be clearer and to avoid using it again.
             3. In sentence 4, give speciﬁc details about the passengers to make the narrative
              more interesting. (Hint: The passengers were a combination of wealthy people and
              immigrants on their way to America.)

             4. Combine sentences 5 and 6 with and.

             5. Combine sentences 7 and 8 with when.
             6. Sentences 12, 13, and 14 are short and choppy. Combine them into one sentence.
              (Hint: Use the verb turn only once, in the past progressive. Use and to add
              sentence 14.

                                  different than it is now.  For instance, they may have online video appointments with

                                  when people feel sick, they will go to a pharmacy ﬁrst, buy a test, and get an instant

                                  diagnosis.  Then they will to talk to their doctor about it online to receive a treatment

                                  7  For some diseases, the doctor may assign them to a group where several patients with

                            The Dangers of Plastic Garbage in the Oceans

                1  Plastic garbage ﬂoating in our oceans is a serious global problem that affects marine

            life and beaches.  First, injuries to marine life are far-reaching.  Birds and ﬁsh may think
                            2
                                                                    3
            pieces of plastic are small ﬁsh and eat them.  The plastic may cause them to become
                                                    4
            very sick.  A turtle may swim into a plastic bag.  Furthermore, a dolphin or whale may
                     5
                                                       6
            get caught in nets and drown.  In addition to harming marine life, this garbage spoils
                                       7
            the beaches.  It hurts tourism.  A recent study estimated that 8 million metric tons of
                        8
                                        9
            plastic reaches the world’s oceans every year, and this number may increase because

            of the growing population.  In conclusion, if we do nothing to stop this pollution, the
                                     10
            problems may get worse.



             1. To sentence 1, add Tons of before the word plastic.

             2. Sentence 3 needs a better description of the plastic. Change pieces of plastic to
              shiny pieces of broken plastic.
             3. Add another effect of eating plastic in sentence 4. After very sick add the words or
              die.

             4. Add a clause to sentence 5: and it may not be able to free itself.

             5. For sentence 6, make the subjects plural.

             6. In sentence 7, add plastic to the word garbage.
             7. Sentence 8 needs a reason. Add because it is unattractive.

             8. More support is needed in the second part. After sentence 8, add a new sentence:
              Additionally, someone may get hurt by stepping on something sharp.

            8.3   Using Subject–Verb Agreement

            In every sentence, the subject and verb must agree. This means that a singular subject needs a
            singular verb and a plural subject needs a plural verb. Using correct subject–verb agreement is very
            important in academic writing.

            1. a.  A singular verb in simple present ends in -s.  Winter lasts a long time in Alaska.
              b.  For the negative, use does + not + verb.   A goldﬁsh does not require much care.
              c.  Noncount nouns always use a singular       Pollution damages the environment in signiﬁcant
                verb.                                        ways.
              d.  A subject with the words every or each is   Every survey participant is going to receive the
                singular.                                    same set of questions.

            2. A gerund (verb + -ing) is always singular.    Visiting Norway costs a lot of money.

                                                                   3
                                         2
            are able to communicate is by making sounds.   For example, cats purr when they are

                                            5
            together to send information.   Other animals use body language to communicate.
                                       6
            7  A dog uses its tail to transmit many messages.   A tail wag can mean that the animal
                                                       8
            is happy or scared.   Some animals communicate using odors.   Bears will rub against
                                                                    10

            about danger.   Although animals do not have the ability to use words, they can most
                         12

             1. Combine sentences 1 and 2 with the word but. Use a pronoun to avoid repeating
              the noun animals. Add correct punctuation.

             2. In sentence 3, change animals to animal and make other necessary changes.
             3. In sentence 4, change cats to cat and make other necessary changes.

              supporting sentence.

             5. In sentence 7, change dog to dogs and make other necessary changes.

             6. In sentence 8, add the adjective angry near the end of the sentence.
             7. In sentence 9, add Finally, to the beginning of the sentence to mark the last major
              supporting sentence. Be sure to include the comma after this connecting word.

            career, Shakespeare wrote 37 plays for a group.   Many people came to see his plays,
                                                      9
            including Romeo and Juliet and Hamlet.   Because he was successful in the theater,

            Shakespeare became a wealthy man.


             1. Combine sentence 1 and sentence 2 using the connector but. Do not repeat the
              person’s name.

             2. In sentence 3, add the phrase the small town of.

             3. In sentence 3, add information about Shakespeare’s birth year. Add the phrase in
              1564 in the correct place. Usually place information comes before time information.
             4. In sentence 4, the important point is that he grew up in a large family, so the
              number of brothers and sisters is not important. Use the word siblings instead of
              brothers and sisters. Change the number, too.

             5. In this biography, the time information is mostly in years, not exact dates. Therefore,
              in sentence 5, there is no reason to include the exact date of the wedding, so
              delete November 28. Be careful with the preposition.
             6. Sentences 6 and 7 are very short and repetitive. Combine them.

             7. In sentence 8, add the phrase at least in the correct place and add the adjective
              acting to tell what kind of group it was. Make any other necessary changes.

             8. In sentence 9, add the play Macbeth as the third play. Make any other necessary
              changes.
             9. In sentence 10, change the word because to the preposition due to or because of.
              (They are synonyms.) Make any other necessary changes.

                                  each day, and it must have access to water.   Next, they need to negotiate a lease from

           and punctuation. Check your answers with the class.

                                   Dangers of Medicines for Babies
                1  Common cold and cough medicines can be life threatening to a baby.   As a result,
                                                                               2
            it is important for parents to be very careful when giving any kind of medicine to a baby.

            3  One common drugstore medicine for a cold or fever is aspirin.   Aspirin can cause
                                                                     4
            Reye’s syndrome, which in turn can cause a baby’s death.   Orange-ﬂavored children’s
                                                                5
            cold and cough medicines are also available at drugstores and some grocery stores, but

            these attractive medicines are not for children under the age of two.   They may cause a
                                                                         6

            is with honey.   Even though honey is a food, many adults and children use honey as
                         8
            a remedy for coughs, but it is very dangerous to a baby.   Honey can have bacteria that

            these reasons, parents need a doctor’s advice before giving any medicine to a baby.





             1. In sentence 2, use a modal. Change the main clause of sentence 2 by replacing it is important for
              parents to with parents should, which uses the modal for giving advice.
             2. Add more descriptive details to sentence 3. After the word for, add the aches and pains of.

             3. Connect sentence 3 and 4 with the word but to contrast the two ideas. Change the period to a
              comma, and use a lower-case a for aspirin.

             4. In sentence 4, the phrase can cause is used twice. Replace the second one with could lead to, which
              shows future possibility.
             5. In sentence 5, replace not with never to give a more speciﬁc meaning.

             6. In sentence 6, the modal may means uncertainty. Change the modal so the verb shows ability.

            11.1  Simple Sentences

            A simple sentence contains one clause. A clause has a subject (who or what is doing the action) and a
            verb (what the action is).

            1. 1 subject + 1 verb                            Japan imports oil.

                                                               S      V
            2. 1 subject + 2 or more verbs                   Japan imports oil and exports vehicles.
                                                               S      V             V

            3. 2 or more subjects + 1 verb                   Japan and China import oil.

            Notes
            1.  A simple sentence has only one clause, which means one subject-verb combination. A simple sentence can have
              two subjects or two verbs, but there is only one subject-verb relationship.
            2. Use a comma between three or more items in a series. Do not use a comma between two items.
                   Japan, China, and Cambodia import oil.
                   Japan and China import oil.
            3.  A sentence with two subject–verb relationships is called a compound sentence. (See Unit 12 for more on
              compound sentences.)

                                    Results of Commuting Survey
                1  For this assignment, we conducted a survey of students at Downtown University.

            2  We wanted to know how many miles they commute each week.   We selected students
                                                                       3

                                                     4
            answer choices were: under 20 miles (32 km) in a week, between 21 and 40 miles
            (34 and 64 km) in a week, and more than 40 miles in a week.   Out of 100 responses,
                                                                   6
            86 selected under 20 miles in a week.   We were surprised because we expected more
                                              7
            people to report a higher weekly commuting distance.   The remaining answers were

            divided between the other two categories.   This information could be useful for future

             1. Use details in this academic report. In sentence 1, add the number of people in the study: 100.

             2. In sentence 2, add the phrase to the university in an appropriate place to show where the students
              are commuting. In general, information about place goes before information about time.

             3. To avoid repeating the same word, in sentence 3, change the ﬁrst word students to participants.
             4. This research took place on August 31, 2016. Add that date in the correct location in sentence 3.

             5. In sentence 4, for a more precise meaning, change one to a and add the adjective single.

             6. In sentence 4, add the prepositional phrase about their commuting habits to explain the question.

             7. Sentence 7 has the pronoun we twice. Change we were surprised to the results were surprising.

             8. In sentence 8, the percentage for the other two answers was, in fact, 7 percent. Because these
              groups had the same number, add the word equally or evenly after the verb divided.

             9. In sentence 9, soften the conclusion by adding the words we believe in the correct place.

             10. In sentence 9, add the word transportation to tell what kind of planning.

            12.1   Compound Sentences

            A compound sentence has two or more independent clauses that are connected by a coordinating
            conjunction. Three common coordinating conjunctions in academic writing are and, but, and so. They
            are also called connectors.

            and    Mexico became independent in 1821, and Brazil became independent in 1822.
                      S    V                                  S    V


            but    Japan imports oil, but Saudi Arabia exports it.
                     S    V                  S          V


            so     Malaysia lies near the equator, so its climate is very warm.
                        S    V                            S   V


            Notes
              1.  A compound sentence has two (or more) independent clauses, which means there are two (or more) subject–verb
                combinations.
             2. A sentence with one subject–verb combination is called a simple sentence. (See Unit 11 for more information on
                simple sentences.)
             3. Use a comma before the coordinating conjunction in a compound sentence.
             4. Four other coordinating conjunctions that are used as connectors in compound sentences are or, nor, for, and yet.
                However, they are less common. Together these seven conjunctions are known as FANBOYS: for, and, nor, but, or,
                yet, so.

            12.2    Using Compound Sentences

            Use a compound sentence when there is a logical connection between two ideas. The coordinating
            conjunction shows the relationship between the ideas.

            1. Use and to add information         Brazil is in South America, and it has many beautiful beaches.

            2. Use but to show a contrast         Canada is a very large country, but its population is small.

                                                  British inﬂuence there is strong.

            Note
              Do not use a comma with so when it introduces a purpose. With a purpose, so (that) means in order that.

                              a comma without a conjunction is called a comma splice and is not correct.

             8. In sentence 8, add a powerful adjective such as prestigious to describe the World Cup.

             9. Sentences 9, 10, and 11 are short sentences with similar information, so combine
              them into one compound sentence.
           10. Read sentence 12 carefully. The information is correct, but in reality, Uruguay and
              Argentina have won twice. Add the phrase at least in the correct location, and this
              information will be clearer.

                                                     The Effect of Sunlight on Plant Growth

                                     1  For my science project, I grew tomato plants in different light conditions to see how
                                                                      2
                                  different amounts of light affect growth.  First, I selected 10 three-week-old plants that
                                                    3
                                                                                             4
                                  were similar in size.  I placed them in ﬁve locations very different.  Two plants received
                                                                             5
                                  approximately one hour of full sunshine per day.  Two others received two hours of
                                  sunshine per day, two received three hours, two received four hours, and two received

                                  ﬁve hours.  All 10 plants were in the same type of soil and received the same amount
                                           6
                                                  7
                                  of water each day.  After three weeks, the results showed that the plants that received
                                  more sunlight were an average of three inches taller than the plants that received less

                                  sunlight.  Though this experiment was quite simple, we can conclude that there is a
                                          8
                                                                                                        9
                                  relationship between the amount of sunshine and the amount of plant growth.  In other
                                  words, tomato plants in more bright locations generally experience more growth than

                                  those in conditions with less light.

            13.1   Types of Adjectives

            An adjective is a word that describes a noun or pronoun. There are different types of adjectives, but
            they all give information about a person, a place, or a thing. An adjective usually comes before a noun
            or after the verb be.

            Types of Adjective     Adjectives              Examples in Sentences

            Descriptive            green, salty,          Examples of salty foods include pretzels, French
                                   delicious, sad         fries, and chips.
            Possessive             my, your, his, her,    Cats and rabbits are born with their eyes closed.
                                   its, our, their

            Demonstrative          this, that, these,     This paper will answer three questions.
                                   those                  Those plants grew very quickly.

                                   many

            Nouns working as       winter, car,           Snow and sleet are two examples of winter weather.
            adjectives             chocolate, computer

            Comparative            -er (newer),           For customers who like newer computers, there is
                                   more (more recent)     always a more recent version available.

            Superlative            -est (the newest),     The newest computer is expensive because it
                                   most (the most         contains the most recent technology.
                                   recent)

            Notes
            1.   Three common endings for descriptive adjectives are -y (cloudy, dirty), -ful (careful, useful),
              and -ous (dangerous, previous).
            2. Comparative adjectives are often used with than. The comes before superlative adjectives.
                   This report is more detailed than the previous one.
                   The third report is the most detailed report of all.
            3. Nouns that work as adjectives have different relationships. Here are some examples:
                   a chocolate cake: a cake made of chocolate
                   a winter coat: a coat used in the winter
                   a passport application: an application for the purpose of obtaining a passport
                   the human brain: the brain that is part of a human
            4. Nouns used as adjectives are never plural, so we say a tomato salad, not a tomatoes salad.

            1. describe the noun they precede                 Runners have to take extra care in humid weather.

            2.  describe a noun or pronoun being used as the
               subject of the sentence
              a. after the verb be                            The weather in Texas in summer is hot.
              b.  after a linking verb (appear, feel, look, seem,     The temperature seems hotter than it really is

            9  A physical difference is the shape of their noses.   The nose of an alligator is sort of
            round.   A crocodile’s nose is shaped like the letter V.   In addition, a crocodile’s fourth
                                                            12
                   11
            tooth is visible when its mouth is closed.   An alligator’s teeth are hardly visible when its
                                                 13
            mouth is closed.   Another general difference is that many types of crocodiles are more
                           14
            aggressive than most types of alligators.   In sum, they may look similar, but they are
                                                15
            certainly different.



             1. Sentence 1 is too strong. Not all people believe this incorrect information, so add the word some,
              many, or most in the correct place. Use the word that you believe is true.

             2. In sentence 2, replace the word animals with the more accurate word, reptiles.
             3. In sentence 2, add the adjective two in the best place.

             4. Combine sentences 5 and 6.

             5. Sentence 7 summarizes what is in sentences 5 and 6, so begin with the phrase in other words.

             6. In sentence 7, change the noun crocodiles to a pronoun because the noun was used in the previous
              sentence, and it sounds repetitive.

                                           Farming for Fish
                1  Fish farming is a type of commerce that grows ﬁsh as food for humans.  Instead of
                                                                                2
            catching ﬁsh from boats, ﬁsh farmers can raise ﬁsh in ponds that are man-made.  The
                                                                                    3
            farmer can also raise ﬁsh in cages that are in the sea or in tanks that are inside buildings.
            4  The type of ﬁsh plays a role in the size of the pond, cage, or tank.  The type also
                                                                       5
            determines the kind of food.  The method of farming determines the number of ponds.

            7  The farmers can buy baby ﬁsh from a supplier, or they can raise their own.
            8  When the babies are large enough, the farmer moves them to a larger pond.  After
                                                                                 9
                                                               10
            several months, the ﬁsh will be ready to harvest and sell.  Fish farming can be a very
                                                                             12

            are overﬁshed.  The human population is growing.  Fish farming is a good alternative
            to ocean ﬁshing.

                                     1  Despite the fact that Kevin Durant is one of the highest-paid athletes in

                                  the National Basketball Association (NBA), nearly everyone who is involved with
                                  professional basketball says that he is very kind and down-to-earth. In fact, an athletic
                                                                                               2
                                  footwear company once made several commercials calling Durant  “the nicest guy in
                                  the NBA.” Even before Durant began playing basketball professionally in 2007, his goal
                                            3
                                  was to help young boys by coaching them in basketball. Today he generously gives
                                                                                    4
                                  millions of dollars to charities, and he reminds often boys that they can be both strong
                                  and kind. Perhaps Durant learned this attitude from his ﬁrst coach, who guided him
                                           5
                                  personal through high school. Obviously, this coach meant a lot to him. Today Durant
                                                             6
                                                                                                   7
                                  respectfully wears the number 35 on his jersey because 35 was the coach’s age when he
                                  tragically died. It is clear that Kevin Durant is a true sportsman because he is athletic,

            Notes
            1.  Adverbs can be formed by adding -ly to the end of an adjective: quick → quickly. For adjectives ending in y, change y
              to i and add -ly : easy → easily.
            2. Many adverbs do not end in -ly : fast, hard, well, seldom, often, very, so, too, quite, maybe.
            3. The adverbs fast and hard can also be adjectives describing nouns.
                Everyone wants fast Internet speed.
            4.  Not all words that end in -ly are adverbs. These words are adjectives: friendly, lonely, lovely, costly, timely, scholarly.
            5. Prepositional phrases can also function as adverbs by telling where (in France), when (at noon), and how (by car).

            15.2   Adverbs of Place and  Time

            Adverbs can describe where and when the action of the verb happens.
            Place: here, there, far, somewhere, in, on, at
            Time: ﬁrst, then, next, last, before, after, recently, soon, later, early, ﬁnally

                       Position                                         Example

            1.  Adverbs of place come before   President Lincoln was shot inside Ford’s Theater in 1865.
              adverbs of time.                                                 place         time

              connected.)







            15.3   Adverbs of Frequency
            Adverbs of frequency describe how often an action happens.

                              0%                          50%                       100%

                       Position                                         Example

              main verb

            Notes
            1.   The adverbs usually, generally, and sometimes can go at the beginning of a sentence.
            2.  The frequency adverbs never, rarely, and seldom have a negative meaning. Do not use another negative word (no,
              not, none, no one, nothing) in the same sentence.
            3.  Adverbs that tell the speciﬁc frequency are usually at the end of a sentence.
                In this experiment, the biologist checked the water temperature daily.

                15.5    Adverbs of Certainty

                 Adverbs of certainty express probability, or describe how certain we are that something exists or
                 happens: deﬁnitely, certainly, clearly, possibly, likely, probably, perhaps.
                            Position                                         Example

            Notes
            1.  Do not confuse very and too. Very is used for emphasis. Too means excessively and suggests that something is
              impossible.
              The hill is very steep. = It will be difﬁcult to climb.
              The hill is too steep. = It is impossible to climb.
            2.  The adverbs barely, hardly, and rarely have a negative meaning. Do not use another negative word in
              the same sentence.



             ACTIVITY 2


           Underline the adverb(s) in each sentence and the verb or adjective that it modiﬁes. Then write the adverb
           type (time, frequency, manner, certainty, or degree) on the line. Some sentences may have more than
           one adverb.

             1. Residents of the United States must ﬁle an income tax report annually.


             2. It is nearly impossible to drive an electric car fast.

            of plastic over the hole, and be careful not to knock dirt into the container.  Put a few rocks

            on the plastic to hold it in place.  In the center of the plastic, place a rock that is the size of
                                         9
            an egg.  The weight of the rock will make a cone shape in the plastic above the container,
                   10
            but do not let the plastic touch the container.  Keep the plastic cone shape several inches
                                                    11
            above the container.  This shape will allow the drops of water that form on the plastic

            to run down into the cup.  Close the top of the hole by putting dirt around the edges of
                                   13
            the plastic sheet.  If the top is not closed, the water will evaporate.  Leave the top closed
                                                                       15

                      16
            until the hole is dry, at which time you can dig a new hole.


             1. In sentence 3, add the adverb approximately to the size. Remember where to put
              an adverb when you use the verb be.

             2. In sentence 4, the depth does not have to be exactly twice that of the container.
              Add the adverb nearly to the depth. Remember the rule with be.
             3. At the beginning of sentence 7, the writer begins a new task. Add Next followed by
              a comma.

             4. In sentence 7, add the adjective any before the word dirt.

             5. In sentence 9, add the adverb about to the size.

           Being a good writer involves many skills, such as being able to write with correct
           grammar, vary your vocabulary, and state ideas concisely. A good writer also learns to
           create longer, more detailed sentences from simple ideas. Study the short sentences
           below.
              Jim Thorpe won two medals.
              The medals were Olympic medals.
              They were gold medals.
              He won them in 1912.
              He was not allowed to keep the medals.

           Notice that every sentence has an important piece of information. A good writer would
           not write all these sentences separately. Instead, the most important information from
           each sentence can be used to create one longer, coherent sentence.

           Read the sentences again; this time, the important information has been circled.

              Jim Thorpe won two medals.

              The medals were Olympic medals.

              They were gold medals.

              He won them in 1912.

              He was not allowed to keep the medals.

           Here are some strategies for taking the circled information and creating a new
           sentence.
            1. Create time phrases to introduce or end a sentence: in 1912
            2. Find the key nouns: Jim Thorpe, medals
            3. Find key adjectives: two, Olympic, gold

            4. Create noun phrases: two + Olympic + gold + medals
            5. Connect main ideas with conjunctions: but + not allowed to keep

           Now read this improved, longer sentence:

            In 1912, Jim Thorpe won two Olympic gold medals but was not allowed to keep them.

           Here are some additional strategies for building better sentences.
            1.  Use coordinating conjunctions (and, but, or, nor, yet, for, so) to connect related
               ideas equally.
            2.  Use subordinating conjunctions, such as after, while, since, and because to
               connect related ideas when one idea is more important than the other.
            3.  Use clauses with relative pronouns, such as who, which, that, and whose to
               describe or deﬁne a noun or noun phrase.
            4. Use pronouns to refer to previously mentioned information.

               A paragraph is a group of sentences about one topic or one idea. It may have a title at the top. The ﬁrst
               sentence of the paragraph is indented. The topic sentence is usually near the beginning and introduces
               the main idea. The sentences in the body of the paragraph are connected to the topic sentence. They
               support and build on the main idea with facts, details, and reasons. The concluding sentence usually
               states the main point again or summarizes the main idea of the paragraph.


                        The Effect of Cellphones on Drivers                    Title

                      A recent study by Donald Redelmeir and Rovert            Indented ﬁrst line
                 Tibshirani of the University of Toronto showed that           Topic sentence

                 cellular phones pose a risk to drivers. In fact, people

                 who talk on the phone while driving are four times
                 more likely to have an automobile accident than those

                 who do not use the phone while driving. The Toronto

                 researchers studied 699 drivers who had been in
                 an automobile accident while they were using their

                 cellular phones. The researchers concluded that the
                                                                                Body of paragraph with

                 used one hand for the telephone and had one hand on

                 the steering wheel. Rather the cause of the accidents
                 was usually that the drivers became distracted, angry,

                 or upset by the phone call. The drivers then lost

                 concentration and were more likely to be in a car
                 accident. The study showed why using cellular phones
                                                                               Concluding sentence
                 while driving leads to increased accidents.
